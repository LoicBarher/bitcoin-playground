# Bitcoin Playground ðŸŽ“

An interactive educational toy designed to make complex economic and technical concepts about Bitcoin simple and intuitive. This project aims to be a "public good" for the French-speaking world, providing high-quality, interactive learning experiences for free.

## The Philosophy: Learning Through Play

The core idea behind this project is that the best way to understand a complex system is to play with it. Instead of reading long articles, users interact with simple, game-like modules that reveal fundamental principles about money, economics, and Bitcoin. Each interactive element is a "toy" in a larger playground, designed to create "Aha!" moments through experimentation.

## Core Features

- **Interactive Modules:** A series of "toys" that simulate economic concepts like inflation, the Cantillon Effect, and the history of money.
- **Modular Architecture:** The academy is structured into "Worlds":
  - ðŸ”µ **The Blue World:** Explores the problem with the current monetary system.
  - ðŸŸ  **The Orange World:** Explains Bitcoin as the solution.
  - ðŸŸ¢ **The Green World:** Provides practical tools and guides.
- **Dynamic Theming:** A clean and modern UI with a user-toggleable Light & Dark mode for a comfortable learning experience.
- **Modern & Robust Architecture:** Built with a professional, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Inline CSS-in-JS (Style Objects)
- **State Management:** React Context API for global state (Routing & Theming)

## Roadmap

This project is currently in its initial development phase, focusing on building the core experience.

- [x] Establish a solid and scalable project architecture.
- [x] Implement the core layout and a dynamic theming system.
- [x] Develop the first interactive toy for the "Blue World": the Inflation Simulator.
- [ ] Develop the next toys for the "Blue World" (History of Money, Cantillon Effect, etc.).
- [ ] Design and develop the "Orange World" and "Green World" modules.
- [ ] Launch the associated YouTube channel and X account.
